## Notes
[This was a very difficult and interesting project. creating the board, Getting the pieces to move properly, implementing bounds and multiplayer, and keeping track of how many of the opponents pieces where capture was straight forward. But implementing the kings movements, the jumps, and AI was a challenge. There were some implements in the instructions that I used in the prototype but a lot of it ended up not being used in the final code, since I found a better way to implement it. When I was done implementing the necessary functions, I was excited to implement the AI. I wanted to see how this would work. I was expecting to add another file for the AI, but instead the AI only required a few blocks of code.]
